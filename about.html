								<h3>About fresco</h3>
								<p> The name fresco is a Spanish translation of the word “fresh.” Our app was created to provide
a refreshing experience for delirium patients through virtual reality (VR).</p>
								<h3>What is delirium?</h3>
								<p>Delirium is an acutely disturbed state of mind that occurs in fever, intoxication, and other disorders and is characterized by restlessness, illusions, and incoherence of thought
and speech. It is a common and serious complication of patient hospitalization in the intensive care unit (ICU).</p>
								<h3>Project Mission</h3>
								<p>Our mission is to prevent delirium in an efficient manner. The current system in place requires more time and resources, which leaves patients at risk without proper treatment. Our application will:</p>
								<p>• Deliver a calming cognitive experience through a gardening game.</p>
								<p>• Record the patient’s progress based on their responses to the VR game.</p>
								<p>• Help treat pain perception, sleep quality, and cognitive deterioration among patients.</p>
								<h3>Research and History</h3>
								<p>Delirium in the ICU is one such condition for which VR technology has not been evaluated. We chose the VR platform for fresco because:</p>
								<p>• VR is a promising application for patient care and rehabilitation.</p>
								<p>• Studies show that gardening helps relaxation, hence the game in fresco.</p>
								<p>• Interventions using VR have produced feasible and e ective therapies for pain perception in su erers of traumatic injury and cognitive deterioration in the elderly.</p>
								
								<h3>About the Team</h3>
								<p>The Dreamers team is a liated with the parent group, the DREAMS team— a research group whose goal is to prevent delirium in ICU patients.</p>
								<p>The Dreamers team consists of Greg Harmon, Jennifer Bernal, Pei Zheng, Denisse Ventura, and graphic designer Yankel Amarante.></p>
